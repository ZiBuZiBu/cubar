## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Omitted the redundant "with R" in the title

* Added more details to the Description field

* Updated documentation of `show_codon_tables` so that \values tag has been
  correctly generated in show_codon_tables.Rd
 
## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note

* This is a new release.
